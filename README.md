# Book Recommender in Prolog
## Developed by Jaume Mora

### Overview
This project utilizes Prolog to create a book recommendation system, designed to tailor book suggestions based on user preferences. It demonstrates proficiency with SWI-Prolog and understanding of knowledge and automatic reasoning.

### Features
- **Book Representation**: Books are represented with comprehensive details including title, author, year, genre, sub-genre, theme, publisher, and language.
- **User Profile Customization**: Users can define their preferences with a detailed profile setup that includes preferred genres and languages.
- **Recommendation System**: The system recommends five books based on user's detailed preferences and allows users to receive explanations for each recommendation.

### Execution
To use the system:
1. Install SWI-Prolog.
2. Load the `SolucioJaumeMora.pl` file.
3. Start the program by typing `inicia.` and follow the interactive setup to customize user preferences.

### Conceptual Approach
- **Prolog Formalization**: Utilizes Prologâ€™s capabilities for logical and functional programming to manage and match book and user data efficiently.
- **User Interaction**: Designed to be interactive, guiding the user through the process of setting up a profile and receiving tailored book recommendations.

### Ethical Considerations
The system respects user data privacy and operates transparently with users having control over their data.

### Conclusion
The project underscores the application of Prolog in developing a practical and user-oriented service, highlighting the potential of logic programming in personalized recommendation systems.
